// The gate, run DETERMINISTICALLY by the runner, not asked of the agent.
//
// implement-prompt.md tells the agent to run the gate before it commits, but that is
// advisory prose the agent reports on itself. Verifying a build is plumbing, so the
// runner does it, and never opens a PR while it is red.
//
// THE RULE (the one place it lives; CLAUDE.md points here): the gate is whatever
// `.github/workflows/ci.yml` on the base branch says it is. `gateFromCi` takes that
// file's text and returns the `run:` steps of its gate job, in order:
//
//   - the gate job is the job named `gate`, else the job named `checks`;
//   - `uses:` steps (checkout, toolchain setup, caches) are not commands and are left
//     out, because the sandbox image is its own environment;
//   - a step this runner cannot run faithfully (an `if:` condition, or a `${{ }}`
//     expression) is skipped, and the skip is reported, never silent;
//   - `working-directory:` and `env:` on a step are applied to it.
//
// When there is no ci.yml, or no gate job in it, or no runnable step, THE GATE RUNS
// NOTHING and says so in the log. That is the honest state of a repository with no CI,
// and it means the first CI job that lands is gated on with no further factory change.
// A ci.yml that is not valid YAML is an error: a broken file must not read as "no gate".
//
// The file is read from the BASE branch (see `loadGate`), not the branch under test, so
// an agent cannot edit its own gate.
